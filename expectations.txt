- I expect to gain general knowledge about fullstack development in this course.

- I believe this course would reinforce my current backend API development knowledge and I'm excited to learn more about websockets and instantatneous communications.

- I'm anticipating to better my skills in frontend layout and design thru the use of HTML,CSS,JS and React.
